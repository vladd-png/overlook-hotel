## Wins

- The application works
- Was able to sort out the API data and use it effectively with a FETCH request for the application
- Implemented SASS in the styles file, and successfully synced with WebPack
- Really focused on TDD for this project, starting with methods in classes, and testing fully
- Implementing spies on global or DOM elements in the MOCHA / CHAI testing suite

## Challenges

- Figuring out POST requests to the bookings API data
- Organizing the project around true OOP, for the first time
- Creating classes that ONLY deal with the data they hold
- Figuring out how to prioritize the requirements of the project. Seemed one path kept expanding into several other to-dos.
